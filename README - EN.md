# Behance Submission Template

A Behance submission is a key part of your larger portfolio. It provides your audience with insight into your project and its outcomes in a well-structured format. To maintain consistency and guide you through the process, we've outlined the following requirements.

## Overview
Every Behance submission should include the following sections:

- **Header**
- **Problem / Question / Assignment**
- **Research** (optional)
- **Process**
  - Initial inspiration and sketches
  - Prototypes and iterations (make sure to showcase all stages)
- **Form / Finish**
- **Final Product**

## Sections

### Header
The header serves as the introduction to your final product. You can offer a teaser of the result here, but keep it concise—no more than one-third of the screen in height. The header should convey the overall vibe of your project, setting the audience in the right frame of mind before they dive into the details.

### Problem / Question / Assignment
Describe the problem or challenge you aimed to solve with your project. Avoid generic phrases like, _"For school, we had to make..."_. Instead, focus on why you chose this particular subject or angle. What motivated you? What was the core issue you sought to address?

### Research (Optional)
This section depends on the subject and the nature of your project. You can include mood boards, relevant sources, and any research that informed your work. It's a chance to show how you gathered and used inspiration or data.

### Process
Outline your creative process. Did you start with sketches, or did you jump straight into prototyping? This is the place to show your workflow, but ensure it is concise and well-organized. Highlight key steps without getting bogged down in unnecessary detail. Not every iteration is equally important, but show enough to explain your progression.

### Form / Finish
Provide a brief overview of the design elements that contributed to the final product, including:

- Fonts
- Color palette
- Materials
- Manufacturing methods
- Illustrations
- Icons

### Final Product
This is where you showcase the completed project. Make sure it looks its best by using tools to adjust lighting, setting, or framing. Leverage these tools wisely to help your work stand out.

*Tip: Don't forget to fill in the "Add co-owners, credits, and more…" section.*

## Settings

In addition to the standard title and description, pay close attention to the following settings:

### Tags
Tags make your project more discoverable. Choose tags that are broad but still descriptive enough to represent your project accurately.

### Tools
List all the tools you used in the project. Be thorough.

### Visibility
Ensure your teacher or target audience can view your project. If the visibility is set to "Private," only you can see it.

### Co-owners, Credits, and More
#### Description
A well-written description makes your project stand out, so be sure to complete this section carefully.

#### Co-owners
Add **"multimediaehb"** as a co-owner of your project. This allows us to track all the submissions effectively.

### Discoverability
Add **"Erasmus Hogeschool Brussel"** as a company, brand, or school in this section. You can also credit other students or creators who contributed to the project. If this was a group assignment, make sure to add your team members here.
